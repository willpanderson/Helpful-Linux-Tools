# Helpful Linux Tools

A configuration shell script to get started on Linux for new programmers and users alike. 

This shell script will install applications that I use from snap and package manager based on each individual system. 

At the moment, I currently am using Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS and Fedora 32, so this shell script will ONLY work on Debian or RHEL based systems

Additionally, I am having some issues with the snap apps and certain libaries on RHEL systems. Will be resolved soon.

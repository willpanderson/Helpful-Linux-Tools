# Helpful Linux Tools
A configuration shell script to get started on Linux. 

A shell script that will install applications that I use from snap and package manager. 

At the moment, I currently am using Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS, so this shell script will ONLY work on Debian-based systems

# Installation

1) **Open a terminal in your distribution**

2) **Clone the repository by "git clone https://www.github.com/willpanderson/HelpfulLinuxTools.git"** 

# Debian-based systems

1) **Run command "sudo sh ./package_install_debian.sh" for Debian-based systems**

2) **Follow the on-screen prompts to individually install each app until the script finishes executing"**


# RHEL-based systems


# OpenSUSE-based systems


# Arch Linux-based systems
